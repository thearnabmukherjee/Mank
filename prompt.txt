### Advanced Steps:
1. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - If no explicit label is mentioned but context points to it, use contextual clues from the surrounding sentences or paragraphs to categorize the content. For example, a discussion about prescription costs should be categorized under **Cost Comparison**.

2. **Semantic Matching**:
   - Use **semantic matching techniques** to compare the meaning of the extracted text with the predefined labels to ensure the right label is applied, even when synonyms or paraphrasing are used.

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - For more complex documents, use **Machine Learning models** like transformers or BERT to classify the text automatically into relevant categories based on the semantic understanding of the content.


Given the provided transcript, extract **only new labels** that have not been previously saved in the system. Ensure that the newly generated labels are based on the context, keywords, and unique themes that have not been categorized before. Do not repeat or re-categorize the old labels that have already been stored.

### New Labels Identification Criteria:

1. **Contextual Relevance**:
   - Identify any new concepts, ideas, or unique aspects in the text that are **not already covered** by the existing labels. This includes new terms or emerging trends in the conversation that may require a separate label.

2. **Keyword Analysis**:
   - Scan for **keywords** or **phrases** that have not been assigned to any of the existing labels. If a new term, product, or idea appears that requires a label for future reference, create a new label for it.

3. **Thematic Categories**:
   - If a new **thematic category** emerges that was not included in the previous labels, such as a new aspect of the market, product, or strategy, generate a new label to reflect this new category.

4. **Label Generation Method**:
   - For every new topic, idea, or keyword group that does not already fit into the predefined labels, create a new label. The new label should be descriptive, concise, and relevant to the context provided in the transcript.
   
5. **Do Not Reuse Old Labels**:
   - Ensure that **old labels** such as "Doctor Feedback," "Cost Comparison," or "Pricing Advantage" are **not re-generated**. Only generate a new label for unique content in the transcript that hasn't been categorized before.

### Example:

- If the transcript discusses a **new marketing strategy** that hasn’t been mentioned before, create a label such as "New Marketing Strategy" instead of using "Market Launch Focus" or "Promotional Material Request."
- If a **new product feature** or **scientific claim** is mentioned, create a label like "New Product Feature" or "Scientific Claim Validation."
- If the transcript includes a **new product launch** time frame or **geographic location** (e.g., product launch in a specific region or market), create labels like "Regional Launch Focus" or "Geographic Expansion."

### Final Output:
- Only **new labels** should be generated based on the transcript, and these labels should be added to the list of existing ones.
- **Do not repeat or reassign old labels**. Focus on unique, emerging, or previously undefined aspects in the transcript for creating new labels.

Given the product-related transcript, extract **business-focused labels** that specifically relate to **product strategy**, **market positioning**, **sales dynamics**, and **business outcomes**. Avoid creating labels related to general medical usage or feedback unless it directly ties to business strategy. For example, focus on aspects such as **pricing**, **product availability**, **market competition**, **MR suggestions**, and **sales commitment**.

### **Business-Focused Label Identification Criteria**:

1. **Doctor Feedback**:
   - Extract feedback from doctors that directly relates to the product's **market positioning**. For example, how a product compares to competitors in terms of **efficacy** or **patient outcomes**. Also, look for statements that reflect how the product will impact the doctor's decision-making process in prescribing the product for their patients.
   - Example Label: "Doctor Feedback on Market Positioning."

2. **MR Suggestion**:
   - Extract instances where the **Medical Representative (MR)** is suggesting strategies related to **product availability**, **promotions**, or **market differentiation**. Look for how MRs pitch products to doctors or suggest changes in **sales strategy** based on product attributes or competition.
   - Example Label: "MR Sales Pitch" or "MR Sales Strategy."

3. **Market Competition**:
   - Identify discussions about **competitor products**, pricing, market share, or overall market trends. This includes insights into how the product stacks up against competitors, including its unique selling proposition (USP).
   - Example Label: "Product Positioning Against Competitors."

4. **Product Availability Commitment**:
   - Look for mentions of **commitments** regarding the **availability** of the product in the market, stock levels, or delivery timelines. This includes logistical commitments or promises to the doctors and distributors about ensuring product supply.
   - Example Label: "Supply Chain and Distribution Commitment."

5. **Product Comparison**:
   - Extract direct comparisons between the product and **competing brands** in terms of price, effectiveness, or patient compliance. This may involve the **MR's** comparative analysis or doctor inquiries about how the product differs from others in the market.
   - Example Label: "Competitive Edge in Product Features" or "Product vs Competitor Comparison."

6. **Sales Strategy**:
   - Identify discussions about the **sales strategy** or **sales focus**, including any details on promotional campaigns, pricing models, and market expansion efforts. This could also include MR's strategy for promoting the product to doctors and healthcare professionals.
   - Example Label: "Sales Strategy and Market Expansion."

7. **Pricing and Profitability**:
   - Look for discussions about the **pricing** of the product and its **profit margins**. This includes cost-to-therapy analysis, pricing strategies for different market segments, and comparisons to competing products in terms of affordability.
   - Example Label: "Pricing Strategy and Profitability."

8. **Market Launch Focus**:
   - Extract any **market launch** related discussions, including timing, targeted markets (e.g., geographic regions or market segments), and go-to-market plans.
   - Example Label: "Market Launch Plan."

9. **Promotional Strategy**:
   - Look for any references to **promotions**, **advertising**, or **brand awareness** strategies used to push the product into the market. This includes details about promotional discounts, campaigns, or events.
   - Example Label: "Promotional Campaign Strategy."

10. **Regulatory Compliance and Market Access**:
    - If any business-related discussions occur regarding **compliance**, **regulations**, or market access (e.g., for specific countries or healthcare settings), extract relevant details.
    - Example Label: "Regulatory Strategy and Market Access."

### **Final Output**:
The output should **only include labels** related to **business dynamics**, **market positioning**, and **product performance in the market**, **avoiding general medical feedback** unless it directly ties to business strategy or market dynamics. For each product discussed in the transcript, generate a **set of relevant business-focused labels** based on the context provided.

### **Example**:

**Input**: 
Dr. Aupi Kapoor was given PentaKine DSR for his patients, and he confirmed he would continue prescribing it based on its high absorption rate. The MR suggested an aggressive pricing strategy for the product to make it more competitive against competitors like CalciPlus. The doctor also asked about availability and stock levels. The MR assured him that the product would be available for distribution next month.
