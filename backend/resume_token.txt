**Objective:**
Generate comprehensive business insights for the medicine {medicine_name} based on collected transcripts.
{f"Focusing specifically on the label: {label}" if label else "Analyzing all available labels."}

**Context:**
- Total documents analyzed: {len(documents)}
- Labels found: {len(label_data)}
{f"- Specific label being analyzed: {label}" if label else ""}

**Label Data:**

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the label data and reasons to identify patterns and trends.
2. Provide actionable business insights for product managers and marketing teams.
3. Focus on the labels and how can we improve our market position in positive way and also give suggestions if there are any negative labels.
4. Structure your response with clear sections in paragraph format**.
5. Keep the language professional but accessible.
6. Include specific recommendations where possible.

**Output Format:**
Provide a detailed analysis in the following structure:
-[Important**]To the main topic and showing insights which are business useful and relevant to the business perspective.
-The summary should have detail and conscise information where the business is doing well and where they need to improve and work on the business for the same 
- The Summary should be detailed and extended and should be in paragraph format and not in bullet points. 
- The Summary should be in the detailed with no useless information and should be in the business perspective and should be in the business language and should be in the business format


1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Key Findings** (bullet points)
3. **Opportunities** (specific actionable items)
4. **Recommendations** (concrete next steps)
in paragraph format.

**Example:**
The analysis of [Medicine] indicates strong acceptance among doctors, with many consistently praising the product's efficacy. However, pricing has emerged as a significant concern when compared to competitors. Notably, 65% of transcripts highlight competitive pricing as a key barrier to adoption. To address this, there are opportunities to develop targeted discount programs specifically for high-prescribing doctors, along with the creation of marketing materials that emphasize the medicine's superior efficacy. In light of these insights, it is recommended to conduct a detailed pricing study within the next quarter and to organize medical representative (MR) training sessions focused on effectively addressing pricing objections.

**Now generate insights for {medicine_name}:**
**Required Output Format:**

# {medicine_name}

**Feedback**
[Summary of positive and negative feedback, 2-3 concise bullet points]

---

## Competition
[Main competitors and market position, 1-2 sentences]

---

## Pricing
[Pricing analysis and suggestions, 1-2 sentences]

---

## MR Suggestions
[2-3 actionable suggestions for medical representatives]

---

## Additional Insights
[Any other relevant insights]

Keep each section concise and focused. Use bullet points where appropriate.

You are a senior pharma strategy analyst and expert in analyzing medical representative (MR) – doctor conversation transcripts.

Your task is to extract the **top 5 most impactful business themes** from the transcripts for the product: **{product}**.

Each theme must:
- Have a **short, descriptive name (max 4 words)**.
- Reflect **real-world field insights** based on doctor feedback, behavior, and objections from the transcripts.

For **each theme**, provide:

1. **Insight**: A list of **2–3 concise bullet points** (≤ 1 sentence each) grounded in what doctors said or implied.
   - Use inferred **doctor personas or quotes** if helpful (e.g. “Doctors in Tier-2 clinics mentioned...”, “One physician raised concern about...”).
   - Highlight barriers, opportunities, or perception gaps impacting sales, adoption, or satisfaction.
   - Avoid generic or repeated points.

2. **Action**: A list of **2–3 practical, specific, and measurable next steps** (≤ 1 sentence each).
   - Make each action **business-feasible**: field force training, content changes, product improvement, packaging changes, sampling, etc.
   - Where possible, indicate the **type of team/role responsible** (e.g., “Marketing to prepare...”, “MRs to emphasize...”, “R&D to consider...”).
   - Focus on actions that help:
     - Increase prescription intent
     - Improve doctor trust or clarity
     - Counter competition
     - Enhance patient outcomes or compliance
